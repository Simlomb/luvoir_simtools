        <p> This tool illustrates color magnitudes simulated for LUVOIR.
        <p> The underlying CMDs are drawn from Charlie Conroy's FSPS code. The nominal set uses solar metallicity, a Chabrier IMF, and the age is a tunable parameter. 
            the simulation uses 10,000 stars randomly sampled from the IMF. The axes show the color (F606W-F814W) and the absolute magnitude in F814W. The blue 
            magnitude numbers at right are the apparent magnitudes in F814W at the distance given in the slider. Noise properties are made up for now.
