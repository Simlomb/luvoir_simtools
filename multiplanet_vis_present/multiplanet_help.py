<p>This tool visualizes the results of detailed exoplanet
mission yield simulations, calculated using the planet
classifications from Kopparapu et al. (in preparation). The
methodology is described in Stark et al. (2014), ApJ, 795,
122 and Stark et al. (2015), ApJ, 808, 149. The python code
to render the results was written by Jason Tumlinson.

<p>The main plot on the right shows a blind direct imaging
survey for habitable planet candidates, defined as rocky
exoplanets (0.5 - 1.4 R_earth) orbiting in the stars'
habitable zones. The real host stars observed are shown with
yellow dots, with the Sun at the center (hovering the cursor
over a dot will reveal the star name and parameters). The
shade of the dot indicates the chance of detecting a
habitable planet candidate around that star if it is
present. The planets are observed over 1 year of total
exposure time using high-contrast optical imaging with a
coronagraph. At least one imaging observation of every star
is performed to find the habitable planet candidates. For
every detected candidate, a partial spectroscopic
characterization is executed. The telescope aperture and
coronagraph contrast can be varied with the slider bars.

<p>Stars for which a habitable planet candidate is observed are
marked with flashing light blue dots. These are randomly
drawn given the chances of detecting a candidate around that
star and assuming that the fraction of stars with such
planets is given by the ExoPAG SAG 13 occurrence rate (see
the "Planets" tab). Clicking on the "Regenerate Sample of
Detected Candidates" button at the lower left will redo the
random drawing, showing that the exact number of planets
found varies from trial to trial.

<p>The histogram plot on the left visualizes the total
scientific impact of the habitable planet candidate survey.
The y-axis gives the expected total numbers of exoplanets
observed (yields), which are also given by the numbers above
the bars. By "expected", we mean the most probable yield
after many trials of an identically executed survey. Three
sizes of exoplanets are shown, with their definitions given
in the table under the "Planets" tab. For each planet size,
three incident stellar flux classes are shown: hot (red),
warm (green), and cold (dark blue). The boundaries between
the classes correspond to the temperatures where metals,
water vapor, and carbon dioxide condense in a planet's
atmosphere. The warm bin corresponds to the optimistic
habitable zone (Kopparapu et al. 2013, 2014); these planets
can have water clouds. Therefore, the warm rocky planets are
habitable planet candidates. Planet occurrence rates from
ExoPAG SAG 13 were adopted for this analysis. The expected
total number of habitable planet candidates may be different
from the number of planet host stars marked in the main plot
on the right (flashing dots), due to the random nature of a
single survey realization.
