         <p>This is the basic ETC for photometry in multiband images. Choose your telescope aperture, exposure time, and magnitude normalization. The normalization is done in the V band (550 nm). 
        <p> Given an aperture and magnitude, choose the exposure time that reaches your desired S/N.  
        <p>To obtain limiting magnitudes given exposure time, set that time and then tune the magnitude to reach your desired limiting S/N.</p>

          <p>The details of these calculations are <a href="http://jt-astro.science/luvoir_simtools/hdi_etc/SNR_equation.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>. We assume that the pixel size in each band critically samples the telescope's diffraction limited PSF at the shortest wavelength in that channel. Thermal backgrounds are included for T = 280 K, which substantially affects the K band.</p>
