This directory contains empirical PSFs made from the 37 clusters 
in the GO13003 program for 9 HST filters:

F390W, F475W, F606W, F814W, F105W, F110W, F125W, F160W

The PSFs, weight maps and kernels included in this directory for
each filter listed above are 2 arcseconds on each side with a pixel
scale of 0.03"/pix.  

FXXXW_psf.fits  --->  empirical point spread function
FXXXW_wht.fits  --->  sum of weight maps for individual stars that went into the stack
FXXXW_kernel.fits  ---> kernel to convolve higher-resolution filters to F160W resolution within <1%.

The following are defined in the same way as above, but constructed
from the native orientation images:
FXXXW_native_psf.fits  --->  empirical point spread function
FXXXW_native_wht.fits  --->  sum of weight maps for individual stars that went into the stack
FXXXW_native_kernel.fits  ---> kernel to convolve higher-resolution filters to F160W resolution within <1%.

We note that we make a master PSF for each filter instead of an
empirical PSF for each filter AND each cluster, as there are
often far too few stars in the individual fields to create a high
quality empirical PSF. 

***How are the PSFs created?

The PSFs are created by selected stars based on the ratio of flux within
a larger 2 arcsecond aperture relative to a 0.5 arcsecond aperture as a
function of magnitude.  An additional background generated using sextractor
is subtracted from the mosaics. Postage stamps for the individual stars
are extracted, applying small corrections to the x,y centering of the 
star within the postage stamp (typically less than 1 pixel).  The stars 
are then masked for >3 sigma background features and nearby objects using 
the sextractor-generated segmentation maps. The individual postage stamps
(for whatever clusters include that filter) are then averaged to generate
a high signal-to-noise empirical PSF.  I also sum the weight maps, as this
is a great diagnostic to ensure that the centers of stars are not being
preferentially masked during the reduction process (which appears as a 
depression in these total weight map).  

***How are the kernels created?

The kernels are created such that we can convolve the higher-resolution
filters to match that of the F160W filter, the broadest PSF.  I use a 
Hermite functions with a custom-IDL script, acheiving growth curves 
after convolution that agree within <1% at all radii (out to the maximum
size of the postage stamps of 2 arcseconds).  

***How do I use the kernels?

A simple example of how to convolve an image using the kernels with IRAF is:
fconvolve input_image.fits F390W_kernel output_conv_image.fits
