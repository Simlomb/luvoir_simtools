        <p> This tool illustates a key capability of LUVOIR: multiobject spectroscopy in the ultraviolet. 
        <p> LUMOS will have the cabability to place small apertures (0.5" or smaller), up to ~100 per ~3 arcmin field. This capability is illustrated with a hypothetical science case aiming to constrain the relation between stellar cluster mass and the velocity of their outflows in nearby galaxies. The clusters are marked with yellow squares and are selectable just as they would be in a real MOS observation. The selected clusters are highlighted in the hypothetical physical relation at right. These velocities are inferred from the detailed profiles of wind lines such as CII, SiII, and CIV. LUVOIR's ability to obtain UV spectroscopy several mag deeper than Hubble, with >50-fold multiplexing, will enable efficient exploration of novel areas of parameter space. We expect this tool to grow to encompass different types of fields and more realistic spectra in future releases.
